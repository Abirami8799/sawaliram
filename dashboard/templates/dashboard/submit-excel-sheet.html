<h3 class="task-section-heading">Guidelines to fill and submit the Excel file</h3>

<ol>
    <li>The template doesn't work properly on the 'Numbers' application (MacOS). Please open the template using Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.</li>
    <li>Please do not edit the drop-down options or the column headers. If you believe something needs to be changed, please get in touch with the website team.</li>
    <li>The Excel file template has help boxes that appear when you click or hover over a column. The help box provides an overview of the data that needs to be filled out in that column. Be sure to read it while filling out the Excel file.</li>
    <li>Please check for spelling or grammatical errors before submitting the file.</li>
    <li>Do not create multiple sheets in a single Excel file</li>
    <li>You can open the drop-down menu in fields like ‘Context’ by clicking on the drop-down button next to the cell or by using the keyboard with ‘Alt + Down Arrow’.</li>
    <li>You can copy the contents of the cell directly above the current cell by pressing [Ctrl + d] on Windows/Linux or [Command + d] on MacOS. Handy when entering a question with similar information as the previous entry.</li>
